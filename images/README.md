# Image Conventions

Always include two images (aspect ratio 4:3) - the first is the full size image, and the second is 1000 px wide and 750 px tall. The smaller one should follow the convention `IMAGE_NAME_small.jpg` so the image can pop up correctly. Add `<img src="images/IMAGE_NAME_small.jpg" alt="CAPTION">`
